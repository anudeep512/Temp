Companies often have formal registered names that are lengthy and sometimes complex. However, in everyday communication, these names are frequently abbreviated or altered into more colloquial forms.
For example , "Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd" is commonly referred to as "Samsung.". These variations pose significant challenges in data processing tasks where matching these colloquial or abbreviated 
names to their formal counterparts is necessary. As we need to pass the true names to the API for serving the answers to the query posed by the user 

Now the main objective is to find a method that can accurately match abbreviated or colloquially used company names to their formal, registered versions. This involves evaluating different string matching techniques and libraries.

The Following are the methods which I have done an analysis and choosed the best of them for finding the formal counterpart.
1) Counter
2) NameMatcher
3) rapidfuzz - Offers 7 variations
4) Spacy Large and Transformer
5) Tf-Idf vectorization

Performance Measurement:
Each method will be tested against a benchmark dataset consisting of 50 queries, each representing a colloquial or abbreviated company name. The effectiveness of each method will be measured based on its ability to return the correct formal name within the top five results.

About the Methods:

1) Counter:
- The Counter from Python's collections module is a subclass of dictionary used to count hashable objects
- It doesn't perform matching itself but is often used to track frequencies of items, which can be leveraged in matching tasks by identifying common or frequent elements.

2) NameMatcher:
- generally, NameMatcher would be expected to employ some form of fuzzy matching technique, potentially incorporating string comparison algorithms to find best matches based on character similarity and possibly phonetic similarity.

3) rapidfuzz - fuzz.ratio():
- Calculates the standard Levenshtein distance between two sequences, expressing the similarity as a percentage. The distance measures the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.

4) rapidfuzz - fuzz.partial_ratio():
- Compares subsections of the string to find the optimal partial match. This can be particularly useful for matching shorter strings within longer ones or for when names may be truncated.

5) rapidfuzz - fuzz.partial_token_ratio():
- Similar to partial_ratio, but it tokenizes the strings and compares the best matching partial tokens, improving matching accuracy when order is not crucial but token inclusion is.

6) rapidfuzz - fuzz.token_sort_ratio():
- Tokenizes the strings, sorts the tokens alphabetically, and joins them back into a string for comparison.
- This approach reduces the impact of word order on the similarity score, useful for comparing sentences or longer names.

7) rapidfuzz - fuzz.token_set_ratio():
- Tokenizes the strings and calculates intersections and the symmetric difference of the token sets.
- It combines the sorted and unsorted token ratios to score matches, effectively handling cases where the strings are similar but contain additional or missing tokens.

8) rapidfuzz - fuzz.WRatio():
- A weighted ratio that adjusts the calculation method based on the specifics of the strings involved.
- It uses a combination of other fuzz methods and adds a scaling factor for cases like differing string lengths and case sensitivity.

9) rapidfuzz - fuzz.Qratio():
- A quicker version of the simple ratio, maintaining a balance between performance and accuracy.
- It simplifies some calculations to achieve faster comparisons with slightly reduced detail.

10) Spacy Large and Transformer Models:
- Large Model: Use statistical ML Models for generating emebeddings 
- Transformer Model: Uses Transformer architecture for generating emebeddings 

11) TF-IDF Vectorizer:
- It converts text to a numerical form suitable for processing, weighting terms based on their frequency in a document balanced by their commonness across all documents.
- This can be used for text similarity by comparing the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of two texts.

Experiment Results:

|| Method || Matches out of 50 || Effectiveness || Analysis || 

Obvservations:
From the above results we can see that RapidFuzz shows robust capabilities for handling the complexities of matching abbreviated or colloquially altered company names against their formal versions. 
For tasks involving string matching in the context of name recognition, with noisy inputs.

In RapidFuzz token_set_ratio() and WRatio() are the best methods for using.

Finding the best method within RapidFuzz:

For this we now change the experiment setting for extracting the top-1 element and checking the score out of 50.

Experiment Results:

|| Method || Matches out of 50 || Effectiveness || Analysis || 

Final Conclusion:

So from the above analysis we can conclude that RapidFuzz's token_set_ratio() is the method suitable for our use case.
